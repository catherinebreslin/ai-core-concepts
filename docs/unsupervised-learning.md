# Unsupervised Learning


## Learning Objectives

This section will help you understand:

- What unsupervised learning is, and where you can use it
- Unsupervised learning tasks including clustering, outlier detection and dimensionality reduction
- Some real-world examples of unsupervised learning in research

## Overview

Supervised learning has been the most invested in

But, labelling data is expensive. 

Most of the data in the world is unlabelled.

Unsupervised learning looks at ways to make sense of unstructured and unlabelled data.

Two algorithms are:

- Clustering
- Anomaly detection

**Clustering**

Takes data and tries to figure out if there is a structure in terms of distinct clusters. Suppose you have a lot of portrait photos of people. Clustering them might group them into clusters which correspond to specific individuals.

K-means is a popular clustering algorithm. You might have to give the number of clusters, or you might use a method to try and find the best fitting number of clusters.  

**Anomaly Detection**

Tries to figure out if an example is an anomaly. 

For example, 

- identifying fraudulent transactions
